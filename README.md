# Module-1-Challenge
For this project, I was supposed to refractor the code and eliminate repeated tags. I did exactly that and added main, section, and nav tags. I also removed classes that were not needed like header class and kept only the header. I made changes to the CSS file as well. I removed the repeated css elements and periods in front of them. There was no need for them. Added some notes to explain what I did at the bottom of the css file. A lot of repeated styles in css were removed as well. Both the html and css code look cleaner now and easy to navigate them as well. I also added a footer at the bottom which the code needed.
